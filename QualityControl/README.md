# Quality Control Tools

Welcome to the **Quality Control** section of the BioinformaticsTools-Toolkit! This category houses tools and scripts designed to assess the quality of sequencing data and perform preprocessing steps to ensure reliable downstream analysis. These tools are crucial for identifying potential issues in raw sequencing reads and correcting them before further analysis.

## Tools

### FastQC
- Description: FastQC is a quality control tool used to generate reports on the quality and characteristics of raw sequencing data.
- Usage: Run the `fastqc_tool.py` script on your raw FASTQ files to generate detailed quality reports and visualizations.
- Requirements: Python, FastQC software

### Trimmomatic
- Description: Trimmomatic is a versatile read trimming tool that removes low-quality bases and adapter sequences from raw reads.
- Usage: Utilize the `trimmomatic_tool.py` script to trim and filter your sequencing data for better accuracy in downstream analysis.
- Requirements: Python, Trimmomatic software

## Getting Started

To use the tools in this category, navigate to the respective tool directory and follow the instructions provided in the tool's README.md. Make sure you have the required dependencies and software installed on your system.
