# BioinformaticsTools-Toolkit

Welcome to the **BioinformaticsTools-Toolkit** repository, curated by Naomi Kato, Director of Bioinformatics at Lael Corp. This toolkit is a collection of bioinformatics tools, scripts, and pipelines designed to aid researchers in analyzing and interpreting complex biological data. Whether you're new to the field or an experienced bioinformatician, you'll find a range of resources here to streamline your data analysis workflows.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several categories, each focusing on a specific aspect of bioinformatics data analysis:

- **Quality Control**: Tools for assessing the quality of sequencing data and performing preprocessing steps.
- **Sequence Alignment**: Tools to align raw sequence reads to reference genomes or transcriptomes.
- **Variant Analysis**: Tools for analyzing genetic variants and identifying potential functional implications.
- **Visualization**: Tools to create informative and visually appealing plots and figures.
- **Utilities**: General-purpose utilities for tasks like file handling and data preprocessing.

Each category contains its own set of tools, along with corresponding Python scripts or other language-specific implementations.

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the various categories and tools within this repository. You can navigate to a specific category's directory to learn more about the tools available and access their corresponding scripts.

If you're new to bioinformatics or any specific tool, don't worry! Each category's README.md provides a brief overview of the tools and their use cases. Feel free to reach out with any questions or suggestions.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are encouraged! If you have developed a bioinformatics tool or script that you believe would benefit the community, consider submitting a pull request. Please follow the guidelines outlined in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
