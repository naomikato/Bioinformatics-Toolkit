# Sequence Alignment Tools

Welcome to the **Sequence Alignment** section of the BioinformaticsTools-Toolkit! In this category, you'll find tools and scripts designed to align raw sequence reads to reference genomes or transcriptomes. These alignment processes are fundamental in interpreting sequencing data and extracting meaningful insights from genomic or transcriptomic experiments.

## Tools

### BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner)
- Description: BWA is a popular tool for aligning short DNA sequences against large reference genomes.
- Usage: Utilize the `bwa_tool.py` script to align your raw sequencing reads using BWA.
- Requirements: Python, BWA software

### STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference)
- Description: STAR is a versatile RNA-seq aligner optimized for aligning RNA-seq reads to reference genomes.
- Usage: Run the `star_tool.py` script to align RNA-seq data using the STAR aligner.
- Requirements: Python, STAR software

## Getting Started

To use the tools in this category, navigate to the respective tool directory and follow the instructions provided in the tool's README.md. Make sure you have the required dependencies and software installed on your system.

## Contributions
