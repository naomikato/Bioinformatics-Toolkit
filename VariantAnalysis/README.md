# Variant Analysis Tools

Welcome to the **Variant Analysis** section of the BioinformaticsTools-Toolkit! This category contains tools and scripts designed to analyze genetic variants and identify potential functional implications. Variant analysis is a critical step in understanding genetic diversity, disease associations, and the impact of mutations on biological processes.

## Tools

### GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit)
- Description: GATK is a powerful toolkit for variant discovery and genotyping. It provides tools for SNP and indel calling, as well as quality recalibration.
- Usage: Utilize the `gatk_tool.py` script to perform variant calling and analysis using GATK.
- Requirements: Python, GATK software

### bcftools
- Description: bcftools is a collection of utilities for variant calling and manipulation in VCF (Variant Call Format) files.
- Usage: Run the `bcftools_tool.py` script to perform various variant analysis tasks using bcftools.
- Requirements: Python, bcftools software

## Getting Started

To use the tools in this category, navigate to the respective tool directory and follow the instructions provided in the tool's README.md. Ensure you have the required dependencies and software installed on your system.

## Contributions
